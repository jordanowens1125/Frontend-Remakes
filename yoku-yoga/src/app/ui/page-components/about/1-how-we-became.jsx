              Modern postural yoga consists largely but not exclusively of the
              practice of asanas. There were very few standing asanas before
              1900. By 2012, there were at least 19 widespread styles from
              Ashtanga Yoga to Viniyoga. These emphasise different aspects
              including aerobic exercise, precision in the asanas, and
              spirituality in the Haṭha yoga tradition. For example, Bikram Yoga
              has an aerobic exercise style with rooms heated to 105 °F
